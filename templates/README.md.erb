# Your system is currently being wrecked.

The scenarios enforced have been documented in <%= @logpath %>, but it's
generally considered to be poor taste to use these instructions to solve the
problem instead of figuring it out yourself.

A random scenario has been selected for you. If you solve the scenario and would
like to solve another, simply increment the `count` parameter. Each scenario
will be applied only once, so there's no concern about Puppet undoing your work.

Good luck!
